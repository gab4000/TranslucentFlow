# TranslucentFlow
A Translucent theme for Flow Launcher

Today, we have translucent taskbar, translucent start menu, translucent notifications center... but not translucent Flow Launcher ! (we have, but not in the way I imagine)

This theme solves the problem by making your Flow Launcher translucent with an acrylic blur, inspired by other FL themes (see Credits) and other Windows editing applications (TranslucentTB, MicaForEveryone, ...).

> [!TIP]
> To get a better experience, switch your Windows theme to dark ! The light theme is... [ugly](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1407f48-6d63-4816-88cd-1ea9b7779091)

## Credits

To make this theme, I took my inspiration from [Raytrace theme](https://github.com/nitrogeo/Raytrace) and [Acrylic for Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher/discussions/1438#discussioncomment-13035562). Thanks to them !!!
